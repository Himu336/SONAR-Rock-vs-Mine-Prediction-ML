# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction ML

This repository contains a program developed to predict whether the object detected by the sonar system of a submarine is a 'Mine' or a 'Rock'. The prediction is made using machine learning techniques implemented with the `scikit-learn` module in Python.

#**Project Summary: SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction ML**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether an object detected by a sonar system aboard a submarine is a 'Mine' or a 'Rock'. Leveraging the scikit-learn module in Python, the model is trained on a dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing sonar readings indicative of either mines or rocks. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the program enables accurate classification of sonar readings, aiding in the identification of potential hazards underwater. The repository provides a streamlined process for accessing the code, implementing the model, and contributing to its enhancement.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model is sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+(Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks)). It consists of sonar readings that indicate whether the object detected is a mine or a rock. 

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `scikit-learn` library (`pip install scikit-learn`)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for exploring the code interactively)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Himu336/SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-ML.git

## Contributions
Contributions to improve the code, add features, or fix issues are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
